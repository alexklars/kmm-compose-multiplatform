# KMM Compose Multiplatform

A simple app for exploring Compose Multiplatform IOS. Application template was taken from [here
](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform-ios-android-template).

It renders Audio player UI:

</p>

## Set up the environment

> **Warning**
> You need a Mac with macOS to write and run iOS-specific code on simulated or real devices.
> This is an Apple requirement.

To work with this template, you need the following:

* A machine running a recent version of macOS
* [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
*
The [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile)
* The [CocoaPods dependency manager](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-cocoapods.html)

### Check your environment

Before you start, use the [KDoctor](https://github.com/Kotlin/kdoctor) tool to ensure that your
development environment is configured correctly:

1. Install KDoctor with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

    ```text
    brew install kdoctor
    ```

2. Run KDoctor in your terminal:

    ```text
    kdoctor
    ```

   If everything is set up correctly, you'll see valid output:

   ```text
   Environment diagnose (to see all details, use -v option):
   [✓] Operation System
   [✓] Java
   [✓] Android Studio
   [✓] Xcode
   [✓] Cocoapods
   
   Conclusion:
     ✓ Your system is ready for Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile development!
   ```

Otherwise, KDoctor will highlight which parts of your setup still need to be configured and will
suggest a way to fix them.

## Examine the project structure

Open the project in Android Studio and switch the view from **Android** to **Project** to see all
the files and targets belonging to the project.

Your Compose Multiplatform project includes 3 modules:

### shared

This is a Kotlin module that contains the logic common for both Android and iOS applications, that
is, the code you share between platforms.

This `shared` module is also where you’ll write your Compose Multiplatform code.
In `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/App.kt`, you can find the shared root `@Composable` function for
your app.

It uses Gradle as the build system. You can add dependencies and change settings
in `shared/build.gradle.kts`.
The `shared` module builds into an Android library and an iOS framework.

### androidApp

This is a Kotlin module that builds into an Android application. It uses Gradle as the build system.
The `androidApp` module depends on and uses the `shared` module as a regular Android library.

### iosApp

This is an Xcode project that builds into an iOS application.
It depends on and uses the `shared` module as a CocoaPods dependency.
